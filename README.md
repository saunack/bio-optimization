### Simulated Annealing
On running main,py, graphs are generated for the objective function defined in `annealing/function.py` for the following:
- GIF of candidates and objective function as temperature changes
- Temperature vs iterations
- Acceptance probability vs iterations
- Objective function vs iterations
- Plot of the objective function

Initialization and configuration options are available in `main.py`
